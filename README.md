# WooBookings Drop-down Dates (AW Mod)
Primarily allows WooCommerce Bookable Products dates to be selected from drop-down vs the ugly and unnecessary calendar. Automattic somehow don't consider basic functionaility and usability important despite demanding a lot of money for their Bookings plugin ($250/Â£190 per year).

This is forked from  baperrou/WooBooking-Dropdown-coursedates to add extra functionaility I would like, and the vast, vast majority of code is hers, I merely make modifications here and there.

First to remove availability number from drop-down then:
  - Add an option to enable this or not (once I've read through the code properly and played with adding options to WooCommerce!)
    Need to see whether to add to each product? Or as a global setting somehow?
  - Create shortcode so can list/display dates available in Content area. Could do this sepearately, but makes sense to add to this plugin.
    Or simplify plugin and add to own site-specific plugin.
  - Aim to keep in sync with baperrou/WooBooking-Dropdown-coursedates, and if that implements similar or better changes, wil defer to that as I would not describe myself as an experienced coder.

The below readme is based on the original plugin as provided by DO IT SIMPLY LTD.
